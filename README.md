## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I got started in technology with Linux. Linux led me to Kubernetes, and Kubernetes led me to cloud.

In my career working in IBM's Cloud Platform- I have written APIs, filed patents, replatformed systems that see thousands of requests per second, and represented the company in audits.

My latest interest is in AI- specifically in building AI-native APIs and UIs.
