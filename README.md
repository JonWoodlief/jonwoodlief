## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a software engineer on IBM's Cloud Platform. My first area of expertise in technology was with Kubernetes. I have leveraged that specialization as a developer of integrations with Kubernetes, as an SRE running a critical high capacity service, and as a security architect working to meet security standards across many governments and industries.

I'm very interested in the application of AI, and I do a lot of research in Agentic AI, MCP, and more.
